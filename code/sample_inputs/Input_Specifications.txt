Dense:

1st line contains an integer n, ie the size (n x n) of the matrix
Next n lines contain n floats, each a row of the matrix
Last line contains n floats, each an entry of the vector b

CSR:

1st line contains t floats, the non-zero entries in the matrix
2nd line contains t integers, the column indices of the above entries
3rd line contains n + 1 integers, the indices of the first entry of each row
4th line contains n floats, the entries of the vector b
