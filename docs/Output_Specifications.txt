Line 1 gives heading titles Stopping reason, Max num of iterations,
Number of iterations, Machine epsilon, X seq tolerance, Residual seq tolerance
of information on line 2

Line 2 consists of:
Possible stopping reasons - String
    "x sequence divergence",
    "Zero on diagonal",
    "Cannot proceed",
    "Max Iterations Reached",
    "x Sequence convergence", or
    "Residual convergence"
Value of maxIts - Integer
Number of iterations - Integer
Value of machine epsilon
x Sequence tolerance used
Risidual sequence tolerance used

On third line, if sequence converges or maxits reached, print n floats, the
components of the solution x, otherwise blank
